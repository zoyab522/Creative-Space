*Drawing program for final CTIS project Spring 2021*

## Original Proposal
- We wanted to create a drawing and digital art project, which would mimic some of the basic capabilities of Microsoft Paint or Procreate.
- We planned on including features such as layers, importing and exporting images, using color pickers, and transforming images and shapes.

## Obstacles
- Distance Working: Git
Since we decided to work as a group, we had to find a way to share our code, even when we aren't working at the same time. At the beginning, we did some emailing with archives, but now we're working a bit more with Github.

- Pane vs Canvas
In our first iteration of the project, we used the Pane class and absolute coordinates to put shapes where we wanted them. However, this was design had a lot more moving parts, and it looked a lot worse than the current design, with Canvas.
In our current version, we used the Canvas class and the Graphics Context to add shapes to the screen. This made the application a lot more aestheically pleasing, but it was also a bit harder to manipulate, in terms of implementing layers and the undo functionality.

## Current
This project was completed in Spring 2021 (by 2 junior highschoolers XD), currently updating and fixing bugs lol see u back here later :)
