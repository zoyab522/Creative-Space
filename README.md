*Drawing program for final CTIS project Spring 2021*

## Original Proposal
- We wanted to create a drawing and digital art project, which would mimic some of the basic capabilities of Microsoft Paint or Procreate.
- We planned on including features such as layers, importing and exporting images, using color pickers, and transforming images and shapes.

## Obstacles
- Distance Working: Git
- Pane vs Canvas

## Logic Flow
